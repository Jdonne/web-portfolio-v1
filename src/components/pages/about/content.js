        </strong>{" "}
        After graduating from university with a degree in conservation biology,
        I felt dispassionate about the work it entailed, I figured in order to
        be in this field (literally, as often than not it would be field work,
        samples, and labs), it required a level of passion that I did not have.
        And so I was in limbo as many of us have experienced, and found work at
        a board game hobby shop. One day I was visiting my family doctor (I
        can't remember the reason, not that I'd tell you), and my good doctor
        somehow saw the limbo I was in. He told me, and I'm paraphrasing, "Hey,
        why don't you explore nursing, you have a biology background, and male
        nurses are in demand, my nephew is a nurse, blah blah blah". And with
        that advice, I went off and found the path he revealed to me to be lit
        enough, and well traveled, so I walked on. After more than a year of
        nursing school, I was doing well, I had a new found appreciation for
        nurses, made life long friends but limbo came along and tagged me again.
        I was deeply uncomfortable with the job, as young people say, I didn't
        have that dog in me; Hence I cannot stress more the appreciation we
        should extend to nursing staff (I can go on but I'll leave that for a
        coffee chat if you ever meet me). And so what happens in limbo? Well, at
        least for me, another neon sign flashes before you lighting a path
        forward, this time, it was a senior nurse that I had no interaction with
        before, they casually looked at me and said "Hey, you know you don't
        look like you belong here, you look like you belong in front of a desk
        and computer". I was taken aback as this came out of nowhere, and it was
        slightly rude. It didn't give me any epiphany as I was already out the
        door, but it did give me pause. I left nursing and was still working at
        the hobby shop as an online shop admin. I could work from home (even
        before covid) most days so I had more free time. I thought why not
        explore web development as I have a good support network for it
        (relatives and friends in the field). And so I started my journey with
        the Odin Project, just to see where it went. I found myself comfortable,
        liking problem solving and making things. After a year I landed a job
        and the rest is history. I did end up belonging in front of a desk and
        computer hobbies.

        Now that we've got the unsolictied story out of the way, time for fun!
        Hobbies and creatives I have accrued include, fantasy basketball,
        collecting music with vinyl records, watching movies, film photography,
        reading novels, and making music. If you are interested in the nerdom
        I've created for myself, I've listed some hobby links and logs below
        (who doesn't like a good list?).
